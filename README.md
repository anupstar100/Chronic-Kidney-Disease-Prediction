# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
## ***Abstract:***
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by progressive loss of kidney function over time. It describes a clinical entity that causes kidney damage and affects the general health of the human body. Improper diagnosis and treatment of the disease can eventually lead to endstage renal disease and ultimately lead to the patientâ€™s death. Machine Learning (ML) techniques have acquired an important role in disease prediction and are a useful tool in the field of medical science. In the present research work, we aim to build efficient tools for predicting CKD occurrence, following an approach which exploits ML techniques. More specifically, first, we apply class balancing in order to tackle the non-uniform distribution of the instances in the two classes, then features ranking and analysis are performed, and finally, several ML models are trained and evaluated based on various performance metrics.
